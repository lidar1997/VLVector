About the project
=============================

The final project in: programming workshop in C & C++ course.
The project is a generic implementation of std::vector, using stack memory 
until some pre-defined capacity, and after that uses a dynamic allocated 
memory (heap).



File description
=============================

vl_vector.h - declaration and implementations of the vl_vector - a generic vector 
              that uses both dynamic and static memory (heap and stack) for improved 
              performance.

vl_string - implementation of string using vl_vector.
